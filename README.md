# Legaproxy

This project stems from my use of older portable devices, which are generally
far cheaper than the latest and greatest pushed by manufacturers. I find it
difficult to impossible to use many webapps and sites due to expired
certificates and use of javascript features that my phones and other devices
don't support.

This application was based on the getting started guide at
<https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>, tutorial at
<https://github.com/docker/getting-started>, and sample app source at
<https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app>, because originally I
thought Babel was my best potential solution to the javascript problem,
and, not wanting to pollute my dev machine with npm ever again, was going
to run it in a Docker image. I'm glad I did, because I learned a lot about
Docker, but decided to code my own JavaScript translator after finding the
ANTLR4 parser project.

* antlr4 runs way too slowly for realtime processing of javascript. I will
  have to return unprocessed script at first, and process it in the background,
  to be available on reload. (2024-06-05)
* Need to change storage of retrieved files to use sha256sums as filenames,
  and have the existing directory structure symlink to these files instead.
  This will allow easier retrieval of cached modified scripts. (2024-06-05)
* Need to change capabilities.html to retrieve a report from the browser via
  an xhr, save that information for the useragent hash, and use it to determine
  which js features need to be translated. (2024-06-05)
* Lexing a large-ish (300kb) blob of minimized js takes over 10 minutes in
  Python, and parsing another minute or more. Using
  [C++](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5308882/ANTLR-Parsing-and-Cplusplus-Part-1-Introduction)
  or Java should reduce that time.
* My minimized lexer in JavaScript/Python3 is currently failing on string
  interpolations (the `${...}` syntax) that span multiple template strings.
  My first choice was to process the first-pass lexing in reverse, so as to
  insert the post-processed shards into the token strings list in one pass,
  but this discovery nixes that approach. It will have to be done in forward
  order with a state machine, making a multi-level list, then flatten it when
  done. And probably better to move it from the lexer into the parser, but
  not sure about that.
